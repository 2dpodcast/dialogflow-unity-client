# api.ai: Sample Unity app.

This is a sample Unity app that demonstrates how to use [Api.ai Unity Plugin](https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-unity) in an app.

The API.AI Unity Plugin makes it easy to integrate the [API.AI natural language processing API] (http://api.ai) into your Unity project. API.AI allows using voice commands and integration with dialog scenarios defined for a particular agent in API.AI.
